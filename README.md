# referral_nfts

This contract allows users to specify their data and referral when minting. The NFT is not transferable.

There's also a server part, `server.js`, which generates the images. It needs `signup-sheet.jpg` (NFT image without text), `icon.png` (NFT collection icon), and `font.ttf` (NFT text font) to work, which are not included because they might be copyrighted and I'm too lazy to check
